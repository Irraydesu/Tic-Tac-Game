# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
 This is a random ticcy-tacca game I made on a fine Tuesday evening cuz I was bored
 ## Rules of the game :-
**=>** It is a game on a **3x3 grid**. **Two players** take turns marking **X** and **O**. <br> 
**=>** **Goal**: be the first to create a line of 3 marks in a row. <br> 
> The code is attached with the repository. Note that the game supports both two player going against physically and if you are a loner (*high probability*) than you can play with the computer. The default setting is against the computer.<br>
**Two player** : Either remove or comment out the **computer(Board)** function from the root and do the same from **while loop** along with **last two** running functions.
